# Project Overview
Sound Sync is a web platform designed to help musicians find their perfect bandmates and bands find their missing member. By creating a user profile, including instruments played, collaboration types they wish for, genres they want to play, etc, artists can be matched with the band that fits their style. Bands can also create profiles to search for the right members, making it easier to connect with aspiring musicians.

# Challenges and Solutions
### 1. Getting MongoDB and JavaScript to work together:
    Difficulties in setting up and integrating MongoDB with our backend
###     Solution:
    We read through documentation, debugged errors, and tested for a smooth connection.
### 2. Choosing a frontend framework
    Initially considered Streamlit but realized that the python usage was too heavy. Tried using Figma.
###     Solution:
    Switched to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for better flexibility.
### 3. Lack of time
    With a limited timeframe, we struggled to implement all of our desired features.
###     Solution:
    We prioritized core functionalities, sacrificed non-essential features, and divided tasks efficiently.
